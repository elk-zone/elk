# Contributing Guide

Hi! We are really excited that you are interested in contributing to Elk. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guide.

Refer also to https://github.com/antfu/contribute.

### Online

You can use [StackBlitz Codeflow](https://stackblitz.com/codeflow) to fix bugs or implement features. You'll also see a Codeflow button on PRs to review them without a local setup. Once the elk repo has been cloned in Codeflow, the dev server will start automatically and print the URL to open the App. You should receive a prompt in the bottom-right suggesting to open it in the Editor or in another Tab. To learn more, check out the [Codeflow docs](https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/what-is-codeflow).

### Local Setup

To develop and test the Elk package:

1. Fork the Elk repository to your own GitHub account and then clone it to your local device.

2. Ensure using the latest Node.js (16.x).
If you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you can run `nvm i` to install the required version.


3. The package manager used to install and link dependencies must be [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v7. To use it you must first enable [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) by running `corepack enable`. (Note: on Linux in a standard Node 16+ environment, you should follow the instructions to install via Node's `corepack` rather than using the `curl` command)

4. Check out a branch where you can work and commit your changes:
```shell
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

1. Run `pnpm i` in Elk's root folder

2. Run `pnpm nuxi prepare` in Elk's root folder

3. Run `pnpm dev` in Elk's root folder to start dev server or `pnpm dev:mocked` to start dev server with `@elkdev@universeodon.com` user.

We recommend installing [ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni#ni), that will use the right package manager in each of your projects. If `ni` is installed, you can instead run:

```
ni
nr dev
```

### Testing

Elk uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). You can run the test suite with:

```
nr test
```

### Running PWA on dev server

In order to run Elk with PWA enabled, run `pnpm dev:pwa` in Elk's root folder to start dev server or `pnpm dev:mocked:pwa` to start dev server with `@elkdev@universeodon.com` user.

You should test the Elk PWA application on private browsing mode on any Chromium based browser: will not work on Firefox and Safari.

If not using private browsing mode, you will need to uninstall the PWA application from your browser once you finish testing:
- Open `Dev Tools` (`Option + âŒ˜ + J` on macOS, `Shift + CTRL + J` on Windows/Linux)
- Go to `Application > Storage`, you should check following checkboxes:
    - Application: [x] Unregister service worker
    - Storage: [x] IndexedDB and [x] Local and session storage
    - Cache: [x] Cache storage and [x] Application cache
- Click on `Clear site data` button
- Go to `Application > Service Workers` and check the current `service worker` is missing or has the state `deleted` or `redundant`

## CI errors

Sometimes when you push your changes to create a new pull request (PR), the CI can fail, but we cannot check the logs to see what went wrong.

If you are getting **Semantic Pull Request** error, please check the [Semantic Pull Request](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) documentation.

You can run the following commands on your local environment to fix CI errors:
- `pnpm test:unit` to run unit tests, maybe you also need to update snapshots
- `pnpm test:typecheck` to run TypeScript checks run on CI

## RTL Support

Elk supports `right-to-left` languages, we need to make sure that the UI is working correctly in both directions.

Simple approach used by most websites of relying on direction set in HTML element does not work because direction for various items, such as timeline, does not always match direction set in HTML.

We've added some `UnoCSS` utilities styles to help you with that:
- Do not use `left/right` padding and margin: for example `pl-1`. Use `padding-inline-start/end` instead. So `pl-1` should be `ps-1`, `pr-1` should be `pe-1`. Same rules applies for margin.
- Do not use `rtl-` classes, such as `rtl-left-0`.
- For icons that should be rotated for RTL, add `class="rtl-flip"`. This can only be used for icons outside of elements with `dir="auto"`, such as timeline, and is the only exception from rule above. For icons inside timeline it might not work as expected.
- For absolute positioned elements, don't use `left/right`: for example `left-0`. Use `inset-inline-start/end` instead. `UnoCSS` shortcuts are `inset-is` for `inset-inline-start` and `inset-ie` for `inset-inline-end`. Example: `left-0` should be replaced with `inset-is-0`.
- If you need to change border radius for an entire left or right side, use `border-inline-start/end`. `UnoCSS` shortcuts are `rounded-is` for left side, `rounded-ie` for right side. Example: `rounded-l-5` should be replaced with `rounded-ie-5`.
- If you need to change border radius for one corner, use `border-start-end-radius` and similar rules. `UnoCSS` shortcuts are `rounded` + top/bottom as either `-bs` (top) or `-be` (bottom) + left/right as either `-is` (left) or `-ie` (right). Example: `rounded-tl-0` should be replaced with `rounded-bs-is-0`.

## Internationalization

We are using [vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/) via [nuxt-i18n](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/) to handle internationalization.

### Adding a new language

1. Add a new file in [locales](./locales) folder with the language code as the filename.
2. Copy [en-US](./locales/en-US.json) and translate the strings.
3. Add the language to the `locales` array in [config/i18n.ts](./config/i18n.ts#L61), below `en` and `ar`:
   - If your language have multiple country variants, add the generic one for language only (only if there are a lot of common entries, you can always add it as a new one)
      - Add all country variants in [country variants object](./config/i18n.ts#L12)
      - Add all country variants files with empty `messages` object: `{}`
      - Translate the strings in the generic language file
      - Later, when anyone wants to add the corresponding translations for the country variant, just override any entry in the corresponding file: you can see an example with `en` variants.
   - If the generic language already exists:
      - If the translation doesn't differ from the generic language, then add the corresponding translations in the corresponding file
      - If the translation differs from the generic language, then add the corresponding translations in the corresponding file and remove it from the country variants entry
4. If the language is `right-to-left`, add `dir` option with `rtl` value, for example, for [ar](./config/i18n.ts#L71)
5. If the language requires special pluralization rules, add `pluralRule` callback option, for example, for [ar](./config/i18n.ts#L72)

Check [Pluralization rule callback](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/pluralization.html#custom-pluralization) for more info.

### Messages interpolation

Most of the messages used in Elk do not require any interpolation, however, there are some messages that require interpolation: check [Message Format Syntax](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/syntax.html) for more info.

We're using these types of interpolation:
- [List interpolation](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/syntax.html#list-interpolation)
- [Named interpolation](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/syntax.html#interpolations)
- [Linked messages](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/syntax.html#linked-messages)
- [Literal interpolation](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/syntax.html#literal-interpolation)

#### List interpolation

You can access the elements of the list using the object notation using the index: for example, `{0}` for the first element, `{1}` for the second, `{2}` for the third and so on.

#### Named interpolation

Elk will use named interpolation only to handle plurals for number formatting. We have 2 scenarios for this:
- using `plural` **with** `i18n-t` component
- using `plural` **without** `i18n-t` component

Check [Custom Plural Number Formatting Entries](#custom-plural-number-formatting-entries) for custom plural entries in Elk with available values for interpolation.

When using plural number formatting, we'll have always `{n}` available in the message, for example, `You have {n} new notifications|You have {n} new notification|You have {n} new notifications` or `You have no new notifications|You have 1 new notification|You have {n} new notifications`.

We've included `v` named parameter, it will be used to pass the formatted number using [Intl.NumberFormat::format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/format): will be the number with separators symbols. The exception to previous rule is when we're using `plural` **with** `i18n-t` component, in this case, we'll need to use `{0}` instead `{v}` to access the number.

Additionally, Elk will use [compact notation for numbers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat#parameters) for some entries, check `notation` and `compactDisplay` options: for example, `1K` for `1000`, `1M` for `1000000`, `1B` for `1000000000` and so on. That entry will be available in the message using `{v}` named parameter (or `{0}` if using the message **with** `i18n-t` component).

You can run this code in your browser console to see how it works:
```ts
[1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567].forEach((n) => {
  const acc = {}

  Array.from(['en-US', 'en-GB', 'de-DE', 'zh-CN', 'ja-JP', 'es-ES', 'fr-FR', 'cs-CZ', 'ar-EG']).forEach((l) => {
    const nf = new Intl.NumberFormat(l, {
      style: 'decimal',
      maximumFractionDigits: 0,
    })
    const nf2 = new Intl.NumberFormat(l, {
      notation: 'compact',
      compactDisplay: 'short',
      maximumFractionDigits: 1,
    })
    acc[l] = {
      number: n,
      format: nf.format(n),
      compact: nf2.format(n),
    }
  })
  console.table(acc)
})
```

#### Custom Plural Number Formatting Entries

**Warning**:
Either **{0}** or **{v}** should be used with the exception being custom plurals entries using the `{n}` placeholder.

This is the full list of entries that will be available for number formatting in Elk:
- `action.boost_count` (no need to be included, we should use always `en-US` entry): `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**
- `action.favourite_count` (no need to be included, we should use always `en-US` entry): `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**
- `action.reply_count` (no need to be included, we should use always `en-US` entry): `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**
- `account.followers_count`: `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**
- `account.following_count`: `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**
- `account.posts_count`: `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**
- `compose.drafts`: `{v}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{v} should be used**
- `notification.followed_you_count`: `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**
- `status.poll.count`: `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**
- `time_ago_options.*`: `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**: since numbers will be always small, we can also use `{n}`
- `timeline.show_new_items`: `{v}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{v} should be used**
