# Elk is in early alpha ⚠️ 

It is already quite usable, but it isn't ready for wide adoption yet. We recommend you to use if if you would like to help us building it. We appreciate your feedback and contributions. Check out the [Open Issues](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk/issues) and jump in the action. Join the [Elk discord server](https://chat.elk.zone) to chat with us and learn more about the project.

The client is deployed to [elk.zone](https://elk.zone), you can share screenshots on social media but we prefer you avoid sharing this URL directly until the app is more polished. Feel free to share the URL with your friedns and invite others you think could be interested in helping to improve Elk.

## Contributing

We're really excited that you're interested in contributing to Elk! Before submitting your contribution, please read through the following guide.

### Online

You can use [StackBlitz CodeFlow](https://stackblitz.com/codeflow) to fix bugs or implement features. You'll also see a CodeFlow button on PRs to review them without a local setup. Once the elk repo has been cloned in CodeFlow, the dev server will start automatically and print the URL to open the App. You should receive a prompt in the bottom-right suggesting to open it in the Editor or in another Tab. To learn more, check out the [CodeFlow docs](https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/what-is-codeflow).

### Local Setup

Clone the repository and run on the root folder:

```
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

`Warning`: you will need `corepack` enabled, check out the [Elk Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for a detailed guide on how to set up the project locally.

We recommend installing [ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni#ni), that will use the right package manager in each of your projects. If `ni` is installed, you can instead run:

```
ni
nr dev
```

### Testing

Elk uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). You can run the test suite with:

```
nr test
```
