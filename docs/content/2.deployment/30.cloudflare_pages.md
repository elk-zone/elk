# Cloudflare Pages
> üëãüèº **Before you continue:** please read through the [Getting Started](10.getting_started.md) page as it contains important information that can help you avoid common gotchas. It also has instructions to help you fork the Elk repository and to configure a Cloudflare KV namespace, which are prerequisites to the section below.
--------------
## Introduction
This section covers the basics of deploying Elk to Cloudflare Pages. Many of the steps in this guide can be completed using the Cloudflare Dashboard or Cloudflare's command-line interface, [`wrangler`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), but some of the steps can <u>only</u> be completed using Wrangler while others can only be completed using the Dashboard. In order to minimize confusion, this guide focuses on the `wrangler` (CLI) approach as much as possible.

If you prefer to use the Cloudflare Dashboard, please refer to [Cloudflare's official documentation](https://pages.cloudflare.com) to set up your Pages project and for guidance on using [Direct Upload](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/direct-upload/) to publish your site.


## Initial (one-time) setup
<details>
<summary>Create a Cloudflare Pages Project</summary>
<br>

You'll need to create a Cloudflare Pages project before you can upload your assets. To do this, replace the placeholder values and run the following command:
```sh
wrangler pages project create YOUR_DESIRED_CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME --production-branch GITHUB_BRANCH_YOU_ARE_USING
```
<details>
<summary><b>üëÄ Known Gotcha</b></summary>

> If you omit the --production-branch flag, Cloudflare Pages designates the first branch that you publish as your <u>Production</u> deployment. If, later on, you publish a different branch using the *same* project name, Cloudflare Pages will designate that as your <u>Preview</u> deployment.
</details>

<BR>

Then, in your browser, navigate to the *account-level* [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), then click on the "Pages" link in the left-side navigation bar. You should see your newly-created Pages project near the top of the list:
<BR><BR>
![Screenshot of the Pages section of the Cloudflare Dashboard](/docs/images/selfhosting-guide/cf-pages-project.png)
<BR><BR>
Click on the name of your Pages project, then navigate to Settings > Environment variables > Add variables:
<BR><BR>
![Screenshot of the Pages section of the Cloudflare Dashboard](/docs/images/selfhosting-guide/cf-pages-settings-1.png)
<BR><BR>
Add the following environment variables to your Production environment:

| Variable name | value |
| :- | -: |
`HOST` | `0.0.0.0`
`NODE_ENV` | `production`
`NUXT_DEPLOY_URL` | `https://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ELK_DOMAIN`
`NUXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SERVER` | `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_MASTODON_DOMAIN`
`NUXT_STORAGE_DRIVER` | `kv-binding`
`PORT` | `443`

Once you've added all the values, click save, then click the "Functions" link:
<BR><BR>
![Screenshot of the Pages section of the Cloudflare Dashboard](/docs/images/selfhosting-guide/cf-pages-settings-2.png)

Scroll down the page until you reach the section labeled **KV namespace bindings**. Enter `STORAGE` (in all-caps) in the box labeled **Variable name**, then select the namespace that you [created earlier](10.getting_started.md) from the drop-down menu. Lastly, click **Save**:

<details>
<summary>Install (or Update) Cloudflare Wrangler</summary>
<br>

If you haven't done so already, install Cloudflare's command-line interface, Wrangler, by running:
```sh 
npm -g add wrangler
```

<br>

If you already have `wrangler` installed, verify that you're running wrangler 2.10+ by calling `wrangler version`. To update, run:

```sh
npm -g update wrangler
```

<details>
<summary><b>üëÄ Known Gotcha</b></summary>

> Installing wrangler to the local (Elk project) directory is strongly discouraged as doing so may inadvertently trigger a cascade of errors stemming from incompatible dependencies while simultaneously throwing the `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `package.json` files out of sync. This will, in turn, cause Elk build-time errors.
> 
> If you don't want to install `wrangler` globally (or lack the permissions to do so), then we recommend using the `npx` command instead of installing `wrangler` to the project directory. To do this, simply prepend `npx` to any command in this guide that begins with `wrangler`. For example, `wrangler pages dev` would become `npx wrangler pages dev`. Note: this approach still requires that you have npm installed.
>
> If you run into problems during Wrangler installation, please refer to [Cloudflare's Wrangler documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting steps

## Build and publish

> üëÄ There's a bash script at the [end of this guide](#resources) that combines the following steps

Open a terminal window, and change the working directory to the folder containing the forked repository:
```sh
cd REPLACE_WITH_THE_PATH_TO_THE_LOCAL_CLONE_OF_THE_ELK_REPO
```

Install project dependencies by running the following command:
```sh
npx pnpm --filter=\!./docs i
``` 

Build the app by replacing the placeholder values and running the following command:
```sh
NODE_ENV=production \
  HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  NUXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SERVER=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_MASTODON_DOMAIN \
  NUXT_DEPLOY_URL=https://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ELK_DOMAIN \
  NUXT_STORAGE_DRIVER=kv-binding \
  VITE_DEV_PWA=true \
  NITRO_PRESET=cloudflare_pages npx nuxi build
```

<details>
<summary><b>üëÄ Known Gotcha</b></summary>

> There's a fix for [unjs/nitro issue #196](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/issues/196), [unjs/nitro issue #497](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/issues/497), and [unjs/nitro issue #787](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/issues/787) working its way through the review process. If you find that your deployment is unable to handle `POST` requests, you may need to wait until that fix is officially released or patch your nitro dependency to include [unjs/nitro PR #968](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/pull/968) and (optionally) [unjs/nitro PR #965](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/pull/965).
</details>

Upon the completion of a successful build, you will find two (2) additional folders in your project directory: `.nuxt` and `.output`. For the purposes of Cloudflare Pages, we only care about the `.output/public` folder.

Publish your site to Cloudflare Pages by running the following command

```sh
wrangler pages publish .output/public --project-name=YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME --branch=GITHUB_BRANCH_YOU_ARE_USING
```

## That's it! ü•≥ 
You should be able to see your Elk deployment by visiting the link provided by `wrangler` upon completion

## CI/CD using Github Actions
<details>
<summary><b>üëÄ Known Gotcha</b></summary>

> You have to set up your Cloudflare Pages project [as described above](#initial-one-time-setup) before you can use the Github Actions workflow.
</details>

A Github Actions workflow definition file that can be used to automate deployments to Cloudflare Pages is included in the Elk project repository (see `./.github/workflows/cloudflare_pages.yml`). The included workflow is configured to use a manual trigger by default, and includes examples that can be used to automatically trigger deployments every time a new release becomes available or whenever there's a push to the `release` branch. To use this workflow, you'll first need to:

1. Add your [Cloudflare account ID](10.getting_started.md) to your fork of the Elk repository <u>**as a secret**</u> with the name/label `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
2. Add your Cloudflare Pages project name to your fork of the Elk repository <u>**as a secret**</u> with the name/label `CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_PROJECT_NAME`
3. Create a Cloudflare API token with `Cloudflare Pages:Edit` permissions, then add the token to your fork of the Elk repository <u>**as a secret**</u> with the name/label `CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_API_TOKEN`
4. Add the following to your fork of the Elk repository <u>**as environment variables**</u>:
    - `NUXT_DEPLOY_URL`
    - `NUXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SERVER`

<details>
<summary><b>üëÄ Known Gotcha</b></summary>

> You do *NOT* need to specify `GITHUB_TOKEN` as this value is passed to your Github Actions build runner automatically by Github.
</details>

## FAQ
<details>
  <summary>Is it possible to set up a CI/CD pipeline using something other than Github Actions?</summary>
  
  > Yes, it is possible to set up a CI/CD pipeline using CircleCI or Travis CI by following the [instructions published by Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/use-direct-upload-with-continuous-integration/). If you've implemented a CI/CD pipeline for Elk using another platform, we welcome your contributions to this guide.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Did you try deploying Elk using the built-in Cloudflare Pages Github integration?</summary>

> **Short answer:** Yes, but we would not recommend deploying Elk via that option.
>
> **Long answer:** Yes, but Cloudflare Pages uses outdated build images that [lack support for Node.js >= v17.x](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/build-configuration/). After spending several hours on Cloudflare Community and Cloudflare Discord, it's clear that there are no workarounds to this issue. Cloudflare representatives on Discord point to a forthcoming update to their build image library, but offer no specific date of release. Separately, Cloudflare Pages lacks native support for `pnpm`; we [found a workaround](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/add-pnpm-to-pre-installed-cloudflare-pages-tools/288514/3) for this issue but that wasn't enough to overcome the build-time errors stemming from deprecated libraries and missing peer dependencies.
>
> If you've successfully deployed Elk using Cloudflare's Github integration, we welcome your contributions to this guide.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Will this guide also work for deployment directly to Cloudflare Workers (i.e. as a Workers Site)?</summary>

> No. While we were able to shoe-horn an Elk deployment to Workers Sites, we would not recommend it based on our testing. Moreover, [Cloudflare's official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/sites/) suggests that the company is phasing out support for Workers Sites in favor of Cloudflare Pages.
