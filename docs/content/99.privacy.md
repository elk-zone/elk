## Information

We do not collect or process your personal or sensitive information.

The only information retained by Elk when you use it is the host name of your Mastodon instance, which we need in order to log you in to that instance.

We use two third-party providers to provide server and content delivery network (CDN) capacity. They each have their own privacy policies which you can read: [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).

We use aggregated information from these third-party providers to let us know about traffic and visits to Elk.

## Tracking

We do not use tracking technologies (for example, cookies). We store information about your user interface preferences in your local browser storage.

## Updates

We will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.

When we update this privacy notice, the updated version will be indicated by a new 'Revised' date. The updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
